In this assignment we tackle concepts about Decision trees and Perceptron

# How to run the code
1. Open the file in the IDE of your choice. I used Visual studio code to implement this program
2. Make sure you have a folder called ```Data``` that contains the csv files (called ```abalone.csv and penguins.csv```)
3. Other folders that was included and are needed are ``` Graph ```. All graph generated will be placed in this folder
4. Other folders that was included and are needed are ``` Model ```. This folder holds the object class of penguin and abalone
5. Other folders that was included and are needed are ``` Performance ```. The performance text file will be placed in this folder
6. Run the program in the terminal by running `python ML.py`
